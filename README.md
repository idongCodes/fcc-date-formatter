# fcc-date-formatter
A simple project used to gain exposure to object constructors - like JavaScripts Date object - and their built in props and methods. Furthermore, I used an event listener, "change", on an HTML &lt;select> element. Inside the event listener I used a switch statement to return a formatted date string relative to selected option.
